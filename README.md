# Using Anaconda
(If you have anaconda already downloaded you can skip this step)

Go to this link https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads

or search Anaconda and look for individual downloads
Download the appropriate version for your operating system (If you don't know what your OS is and your not using a mac, its probably windows)
Run the Anaconda install you just downloaded (you can usually just click next as the defaults should work for most users)

Open the Anaconda Prompt (you can type ananconda into the search bar and it should be there)
navigate to NcaaWebscraperSUUSportsAnalytics-main folder

run 'conda env create -f environment.yml' to create a new conda environment
activate the environment using 'conda activate Webscraper'

Now navigate to the Ncaa folder (should be cd Ncaa)
type 'script.bat' and it enter
