Using Anaconda
(If you have anaconda already downloaded you can skip this step)
Go to this link https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads
or search anaconda and look for individual downloads
Download the appropriate version for your operating system (If you don't know what your OS is and your not using a mac, its probably windows)
Run the Anaconda install you just downloaded (you can usually just click next as the defaults should work for most users)

run conda env create -f environment.yml to create a new conda environment
activate the environment using conda activat Webscraper


Using pip

Go to https://github.com/17aclemons/NcaaWebscraperSUUSportsAnalytics
Click the download Code Button and select download Zip

Open up a terminal
(If on windows, type cmd in the bottom left search bar)
Navigate to the folder where the extracted zip file is located (Usually Downloads)
